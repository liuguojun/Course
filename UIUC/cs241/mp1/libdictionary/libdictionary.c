/**

 * adding to the dictionary.
 *
 * The format of the key_value will be the format of an HTTP header
 * (@link http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/draft-ietf-http-spec.html#Message-Headers 
 * you can read more aboud the headers here, but this is not necessary to understand @endlink),
 * where the contents will be the KEY (one or more non-colon characters), a colon,
 * a single space, and the rest will be the VALUE. (While the KEY cannot be an empty
 * string, it is possible for the VALUE to be an empty string.)
 *
 * This function should NOT copy key_value and should NOT create any additional memory to store
 * the KEY and VALUE pieces of the string.  Instead, this function should modify the key_value
 * string in-place, if necessary.  If the function fails, key_value should be unmodified.
 *
 * Valid inputs:
 * - "Host: www.cs.uiuc.edu"
 * - "MyKey: MyValue"
 * - "a: b"
 * - "SomeLongKey: ", where there is a trailing space after the colon
 * - "Strange: but:this:is:okay: and: so: is: this"
 * - "e: :e"
 * - "This is not common: but it's not illegal"
 * - "Strange:   case", where the value would be "  case"
 *
 * Illegal inputs:
 * - ": www.cs.uiuc.edu", since the KEY is zero-length
 * - "MyKey, MyValue", since no colon, space exists
 * - "a:b", since no colon, space exists.
 * - "a:: b", since the first colon isn't followed by a space.
 *
 * You may assume that:
 * - All whitespace surrounding key_value has been removed.
 * - The parameters will be valid, non-NULL pointers.
 *
 * @param d
 *   A pointer to an initalized dictionary data structure.
 * @param key_value
 *   The key-value pair that is to be parsed and added to the dictionary.
 *   
 * @retval 0 
 *   Success (the key_value was parsed and added to the dictionary)
 * @reval KEY_EXISTS
 *   The dictionary already contains a key with the same name as the KEY in key_value
 * @retval ILLEGAL_FORMAT
 *   The format of key_value is illegal.
