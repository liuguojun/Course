    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In CS 125, CS 225, and other classes, you have used various languages that are considered to be &quot;C based&quot;, but up to now you may have very limited experience in C programming.  This MP will provide a short programming
        introduction to pointers, strings, and functions in C.
    </p>

    <p>
        This machine problem will be divided up into two pieces. In the first piece,
        you will need to write some code to call some 'creatively defined' functions
        so that those functions produce the desired output. In the second piece, you
        will be creating a simple dictionary data structure to parse and hold the
        values of the parsed strings.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this MP, you may modify:
        <ul>
            <li><tt>part1.c</tt></li>
            <li><tt>part2.c</tt></li>
            <li><tt>libdictionary/libdictionary.c</tt></li>
            <li><tt>libdictionary/libdictionary.h</tt></li>
        </ul>

        All other files will be replaced with new/different files for grading.  If you modify any other files for debugging purposes, please ensure you test your program with the original file.
    </p>

    <h2>What you must do...</h2>

    <h4>...for Part 1:</h4>
    <p>
        We have pre-uploaded some files to your mp1 svn directory, including <tt>mp1-functions.c</tt>.  Inside <tt>mp1-functions.c</tt>, you will see ten different functions, including <tt>first_step()</tt> (re-printed below).
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        void first_step(int value)<br />
        {<br />
	    &nbsp; if (value == 81)<br />
		&nbsp; &nbsp; printf("1: Illinois\n");<br />
        }
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        To complete Part 1, you must complete the program <tt>part1.c</tt> so that <tt>part1.c</tt> makes calls to all ten functions in <tt>mp1-functions.c</tt> such that they print their &quot;Illinois&quot; line.  When running
        <tt>./part1</tt>, your output should look exactly like:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        1: Illinois<br />
        2: Illinois<br />
        3: Illinois<br />
        4: Illinois<br />
        5: Illinois<br />
        6: Illinois<br />
        7: Illinois<br />
        8: Illinois<br />
        9: Illinois<br />
        10: Illinois
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        <span style="color: #800">
            You should NOT edit the mp1-functions.c file. In fact, when we grade your
            program, we will replace the mp1-functions.c file with a new version of
            the file (and we'll change the &quot;Illinois&quot; string so printing out
            &quot;Illinois&quot; in a for-loop will get you no credit).
        </span>
    </p>


    <h4>...for Part 2:</h4>

    <p>
        Now that you have some review of pointers, we're ready to make a simple, but useful library.  This library will be a simple &quot;dictionary&quot; that associates a key with value, much like the
        <tt>Map</tt> interface in Java (<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Interface Map&lt;K, V&gt; in Java</a>).  While a true library may contain many useful functions,
        we only require a few very basic functions to be completed in order to complete Part 2: <tt>_init()</tt>, <tt>_destroy()</tt>, <tt>_add()</tt>, <tt>_get()</tt>, <tt>_remove()</tt>, and <tt>_parse()</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In all six functions, the first parameter is a pointer to a <tt>dictionary_t</tt> <tt>struct</tt>.  You can find this <tt>struct</tt> defined in the <tt>libdictionary.h</tt> file inside
        the <tt>/libdictionary/</tt> folder in MP1.  You will find the <tt>dictionary_t</tt> structure, with a single reference to a <tt>dictionary_entry_t</tt> <tt>struct</tt>.
        You may want to add variables to <tt>dictionary_t</tt>, change it to a pointer, or anything else to work with your data structure.  It may be useful to add
        variables inside the <tt>dictionary_entry_t</tt> <tt>struct</tt> in order to store state about your dictionary.  You may find that
        the <tt>dictionary_entry_t</tt> <tt>struct</tt> is enough, or you may create any number of other <tt>struct</tt>s inside your <tt>.h</tt> file.  A pointer to the same <tt>dictionary_t</tt> will
        be used through the entire use of a single dictionary.  Sample code of use of your library can be found in <tt>part2.c</tt>, re-printed (in part) below:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
	dictionary_t dictionary;<br />
	dictionary_init(&dictionary);<br />
    <br />
    result = dictionary_add(&dictionary, "key", "value");<br />
    result = dictionary_add(&dictionary, "key2", "value");<br />
    result = dictionary_parse(&dictionary, "Hello: World");<br />
    [...]<br />
    dictionary_remove(&dictionary, "key3");<br />
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        <span style="color: #800"><b>You should modify <tt>part2.c</tt> to include more robust testing your library</b>.</span>

        We will not use <tt>part2.c</tt> in grading, but our grader will use a custom file that makes use of your library -- it's up to you to robustly test your dictionary.
    </p>

    <p>
        To complete Part 2, you must implement the six functions defined in <tt>libdictionary/libdictionary.c</tt>. These functions are self-descriptive, but a full function outline is
        provided for in the links below.  In this MP, we are looking for correctness over efficiency -- all the test cases are small enough that even an O(n^3) algorithm will
        run just fine.
